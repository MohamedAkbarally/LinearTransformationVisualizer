Linear Transformation Visualizer (LTV) is a tool for students to understand how matrices apply a linear transformation to a rank 3 vector space. The application is written in JavaScript using the react and threejs library. LTV allows users to edit a 3x3 matrix and watch an animation of how 3D space changes when the matrix is applied. Additionally, users can add vectors to the plot and visualize the change in its dimensions as the transformation is applied. LTV also allows a unit cube to be displayed at the origin of the plot. When a transformation is then applied, users can visualize how the volume of the cube changes to the determinant of the given transformation matrix. This will help students strengthen their understanding of Linear algebra. This project was inspired by 3Blue1Brown's series on "The Essence of Linear Algebra".
